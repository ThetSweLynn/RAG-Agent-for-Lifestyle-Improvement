You: I am 21 years old boy and weigh 130 pounds. I am trying to gain more weights. Can you recommend personalized meals for me? 
AI: Your weight of 130 pounds translates to about 59 kg.  To gain weight, you need to consume more calories than
you expend.  A personalized meal plan requires more information about your current dietary habits, activity
level, and any underlying health conditions. However, I can offer some general guidelines and examples:

**General Recommendations:**

* **Increase Caloric Intake:** Aim for a surplus of 250-500 calories per day.  This can be achieved by
increasing portion sizes and eating more frequently.
* **Prioritize Protein:**  Consume 1.6-2.2 grams of protein per kilogram of body weight (94-131 grams for you)
to support muscle growth. Good sources include those listed in your provided data: chicken, fish, lean red
meat, eggs, tofu, tempeh, lentils, quinoa, etc.
* **Healthy Fats:** Include sources like avocados, nuts, seeds, and olive oil for calorie density and overall
health.
* **Carbohydrates:** Choose complex carbohydrates like whole grains, fruits, and vegetables for sustained
energy.

**Sample Meal Ideas (adjust portions based on your needs):**

* **Breakfast:** Oatmeal with protein powder, berries, and nuts; Scrambled eggs with whole-wheat toast and
avocado.
* **Lunch:** Chicken breast salad sandwich on whole-grain bread; Lentil soup with a side of whole-grain bread.
* **Dinner:** Salmon with roasted vegetables and quinoa; Tofu stir-fry with brown rice.
* **Snacks:** Greek yogurt with fruit and granola; Trail mix with nuts and seeds; Protein shake.

**Important Considerations:**

* **Consult a Registered Dietitian:** For truly personalized guidance, it's best to consult a registered
dietitian or nutritionist. They can create a tailored plan based on your individual needs and preferences.
* **Strength Training:** Combine your increased caloric intake with regular strength training exercises to
promote muscle growth and weight gain.
* **Gradual Increase:**  Gradually increase your calorie and protein intake to avoid digestive discomfort.
* **Monitor Progress:** Track your weight and adjust your plan accordingly.

It's important to focus on nutrient-dense foods and make sustainable lifestyle changes for long-term healthy
weight gain.
