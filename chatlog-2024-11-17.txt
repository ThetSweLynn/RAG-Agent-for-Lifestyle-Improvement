You: I'm 22 years old male with 130 pounds. I want to gain weight. Can you give me work out plan and food recommadation?
AI: The provided texts offer general calorie recommendations for a 22-year-old male but don't include specific
workout plans.  To gain weight, you need to consume more calories than you expend.  A moderately active
22-year-old male needs around 2800 kcal/day (source: *MAKE CALORIES COUNT* table).  Since you are aiming to
gain weight, you will need to exceed this amount.

A balanced approach is crucial, combining increased caloric intake with an appropriate exercise program
focusing on resistance training to build muscle mass.  Consult a certified personal trainer or strength and
conditioning specialist for a tailored workout plan.  Additionally, it is important to consult a registered
dietitian or nutritionist to create a personalized meal plan that aligns with your specific needs and goals.
