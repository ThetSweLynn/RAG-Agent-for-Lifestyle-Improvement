        "bot": "The provided texts offer general calorie recommendations for a 22-year-old male but don't include specific\nworkout plans.  To gain weight, you need to consume more calories than you expend.  A moderately active\n22-year-old male needs around 2800 kcal/day (source: *MAKE CALORIES COUNT* table).  Since you are aiming to\ngain weight, you will need to exceed this amount.\n\nA balanced approach is crucial, combining increased caloric intake with an appropriate exercise program\nfocusing on resistance training to build muscle mass.  Consult a certified personal trainer or strength and\nconditioning specialist for a tailored workout plan.  Additionally, it is important to consult a registered\ndietitian or nutritionist to create a personalized meal plan that aligns with your specific needs and goals.\nThe information provided here is not a substitute for professional advice.\n\n\nSources:\n1.
